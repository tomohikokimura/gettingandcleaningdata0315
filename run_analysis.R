# This is an R script that does the following:
#
# 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
#    for each measurement.
# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data
#    set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
