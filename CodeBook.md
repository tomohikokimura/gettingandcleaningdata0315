# Code book for the tidy data set.

## Overview
This tidy data set has been created from the [UCI Human Activity Recognition
Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
data set, and all the features have been derived from those in the original data set.
Please refer to the original code book for more detail.

The feature set consists of the following:

1. subject: An ID of the experiment subject.
2. activity: An activity label: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,
             SITTING, STANDING, or LAYING.
3. means per subject / activity of the measurements on mean and standard
   deviation of the following measurements in the original data set:
  * tBodyAcc-XYZ
  * tGravityAcc-XYZ
  * tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
  * tBodyGyro-XYZ
  * tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
  * tBodyAccMag
  * tGravityAccMag
  * tBodyAccJerkMag
  * tBodyGyroMag
  * tBodyGyroJerkMag
  * fBodyAcc-XYZ
  * fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
  * fBodyGyro-XYZ
  * fBodyAccMag
  * fBodyAccJerkMag
  * fBodyGyroMag
  * fBodyGyroJerkMag

## The original feature selection

The following is quoted from the code book for the original data set,
explaining how the above features were selected:

> The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
>
> Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).
>
> Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).
>
> These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
> '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
